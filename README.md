A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Demo1, Demo2, Demo3, Demo4, Demo5, Demo6.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro and Outro.
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: Created shake method to simplify tweens.
    - Enhancement 2: Created showStuff method to display the name of objects above themselves when hovered over.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Starting Room, Central Room, Closet, Basement, Dark Room, Elevator
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Wrench object, box that turns into secret door
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Wrench, boxes, etc.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Box that turns into door, Vent shakes when clicked without wrench
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Vent shakes, elevator shakes, player icon shakes

Asset sources:
